## Oh My
I think it's time. I've had a few posts already, I've thought about it, it's time for launch!

3... 2... 1... ðŸš€

Alright, now that's out the way, it's time for cake. Cheesecake specifically, or at least that's what the picture is about. Speaking of, photo courtesy of [Deva Williamson](https://unsplash.com/@biglaughkitchen?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) from unsplash.

## Going Forward
Am I done with the design of my blog? No. Am I done tweaking things here and there? No. Software development is an iterative process, and so is my blog. I just finally have something half-way decent to show for it.

By the way, this is my 3rd attempt at starting a blog. 1st was just a vanilla site, right when I had started my college degree. I was pretty naive and it never got past the first HTML page. 

My 2nd was a few years later, using Next.js and a lot more experience. Still pretty new though. It quietly died in the corner because I could never get a good dev environment set up nor an automated pipeline. Lastly, here we are.
